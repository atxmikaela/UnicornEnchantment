## React Project Assessment

You've had a whirlwind tour of React and some of the most popular features and libraries in its ecosystem. Now, you get to do something substantial with it while it's fresh in mind.

You will create a compelling front-end for your completed back-end project in order to complete your full stack application to include in your portfolio. It should be something that you can display to demonstrate your skills.

This is an individual project assessment and you ultimately have the responsibility to fulfill a set of requirements listed in the React Solo Project Expectations reading. If you want to build out the application beyond the requirements, that's great! But you must meet the spec and be signed off by your team advisor before moving to Bonus features. Just make sure you scope the amount of work into something you feel you can complete in the appointed amount of time. Remember, this is a solo project, so task completion will take more time than when programming with others. Use your knowledge of how long it took you to build your last project to determine how much you can get done on your own in the allotted time. The Project Road Map provided will help you track your time.

Important Reminders
You must use plain CSS.
NO CSS Frameworks will be allowed.
User Stories are NOT required.
Students are not allowed to work on Bonus Features prior to finishing requirements to pass assessment. Consult with your advisor if you feel you have met the requirements.
In the list of projects below, if the project lists more than 2 features, remember that you are only required to complete two of the listed features, the required full CRUD feature, and the second feature of your choice. Bonuses cannot replace a feature.
Requirements Overview
Your finished project must have 2 (minimum) or more features in order to pass the assessment.
The first feature must have full CRUD, (Create, Read, Update, Delete) The required full CRUD feature is marked for each project and cannot be substituted.
The second feature should must have a minimum of Create, Read and Delete. Check with your advisor to see if your second CRUD meets requirements.
Before building out features, you are required to complete and fully deploy the Authenticate Me portion of the project.
You must present your deployed application to your team and/or cohort to complete the project and move to the next mod.
Consult the requirements listed in the React Solo Project Expectations reading for additional details.

Project List
Here is the list of project options with their different requirements. The list designates features and bonuses. It also stipulates which CRUD features are required for each option. Following graduation, to have this project be ready for recruiters to see them, you will need to have at least four features, so keep in mind what future features you would like to implement!

In following pages, you will be provided with MVP Wireframes, MVP Acceptance Criteria, and CSS Style Recommendations relating to your project.

## React Solo Project Expectations

You will get dedicated time to write a compelling front-end application to go into your portfolio. This project will build off of your Express backend project you have previously completed.

Requirements
In order to pass the Solo Project Assessment, the following requirements must be met:

Project must be continued from your previous Express API backend project.
You should have the following documentation in the Wiki of your GitHub repo by presentation day:
Feature document outlining 2 MVP features as well as any additional features.
API routes documentation.
Database schema image.
Redux state pseudocode.
Create a README.md file with:
Intro section about your project.
List of technologies used on the project.
At least a single image or gif showcasing the project.
Complete instructions on how to launch the full application locally.
Your app must have user authentication. This should already be implemented by your solution to the "Authenticate Me" project.
Sign Up
Login / Logout
Demo User Login button.
Your app must have at least two major CRUD features in addition to user authentication.
The first required feature listed in the project list MUST have complete CRUD. (Create, Read, Update, AND Delete)
The second required feature should have a minimum of Create, Read & Delete.
Front-end must be built with the following for every feature:
React
Redux (with normalized data!)
CSS
FontAwesome for icons (cannot use Material UI)
Google Fonts for fonts
Your site must be intuitive to the user. User must not have to hunt and guess how to navigate and use your app.
You must create a favicon and a title for your app.
You must have either a landing page or a splash page with proper functionality restricting user access.
You must commit and push to GitHub a minimum of twice daily. For the Full-Time program, once before lunch and once right before EOD. For the Part-Time program, once right before EOD and once before the start of class the next day.
You are required to present your project to the cohort or to your team on the Monday after project week(s), as decided by Instructors.
Not completing any of these Requirements can lead to an Academic Deferral.

Note:

User Stories are not required in this project due to time constraints, but we are providing you with wireframes and acceptance criteria.
CSS frameworks are not to be used.
About section on the app is not required.
Question Asking
During this project, you will be required to create effective questions. In a professional environment, knowing when to ask for help and not spending too much time on any one problem is critical. The effectiveness of being a Software Engineer can be proportional to your ability to ask effective questions. Additionally, making the most out of the time with your manager or Senior Engineers is also vital.

Questions should be asked via Discord or Intercom. When asking a question, please post all of the following:

Error message title or a short description of what you're working on.
Detailed answers to these questions:
What are you trying to achieve?
What is happening instead?
What debugging steps have you taken so far?
THIS IS VERY HELPFUL TO DESCRIBE - Follow your data flow!
Relevant screenshots of code (include explanations of these screenshots).
A link to your repo's branch that you're currently working on.
This process allows instructors to help as many people as possible. The other students in your cohort will also have great ideas for solutions. Further, it will allow us to know if multiple students are having similar issues and if so we can have a group session to clarify if necessary.

DO NOT REQUEST AN INSTRUCTOR TO COME TO YOUR ROOM

Instructors will not pair program with you or build your project for you!

In rare cases instructors may join your room for further debugging discussion.

However, this is purely at instructor discretion, so once again: please do not ask them to come to your room!

Once the issue that you requested assistance with is no longer blocking your progress, instructors will move on to help other students. If you have an additional issue, please be prepared to make an additional post in Discord or Intercom.

Any third party npm packages that you use must be approved by your project advisor and will be your responsibility to figure out its implementation. Instructors are not responsible or expected to learn your particular package. You may ask questions about them, but they may or may not have answers based on your package.

There are extra resources and walkthroughs that may help with your project completion.

This is an Assessment
Remember, this is a React, Redux, Express, SQLite3/PostgresQL full stack solo project assessment. Make sure to follow both written and oral instructions that you are given. This is crucial to passing the assessment. The ultimate goal is for you to grow as a programmer and to have the start of a beautiful portfolio project for your job search.

## CSS Requirements for App Academy Portfolio Projects

First impressions are a HUGE deal when interviewing for a job or presenting your portfolio projects to potential employers.

A visually satisfying portfolio project will more likely catch and hold the attention of a potential employer than a portfolio project that lacks visual appeal regardless of functionality.

To keep future potential employers and interviewers interested in your portfolio project, you must make your portfolio project visually appealing, otherwise you risk being passed over in favor of other applicants.

You might be thinking, "I have time to make it visually appealing after I graduate from App Academy, so I don't need to worry about it now." This is far from correct. You will be very busy leading up to graduation and after graduation. Delaying the work on making your portfolio project visually appealing now will delay your job search significantly.

CSS styling is a big part of making a full-stack portfolio project visually appealing. You may find that the majority of time that you spend on the full-stack portfolio project is on CSS, and that is normal. CSS is the make-or-break factor of your portfolio project from a potential employer's perspective.

The rest of this document will outline what you should achieve to meet the minimum CSS requirements of your full-stack portfolio project.

CSS Specifications
You must follow the design of the application you are cloning as close as possible, down to the colors. This is not a bootcamp for creating designers, and you are not training to be designers. The application that you are cloning is already designed and you must replicate and implement the design of the target cloned site through organizing your HTML elements and styling them through CSS.

TO DO CHECKLIST
Important Note: You must finish the basic functionality of your feature before styling it.

✅ All links, buttons, input fields, and text features on the site are functioning properly and belong to the features that were worked on

✅ The alignment / justification of each element is consistent with the target cloned site

✅ The colors used on each element are comparable with the target cloned site or within professional standards

✅ The fonts & font sizes used on each element are comparable with the target cloned site

✅ Google FontsLinks to an external site. or the built-in browser fonts must be used for fonts

✅ Your site has no glaring visual issues on a standard size laptop (needs to be a desktop version of the target cloned site - 1024px)

✅ The logo and name of your application are different from the target cloned site

✅ Your document page title and application's favicon match that of the name and the logo of your application

✅ The white spacing (padding, margin, border, and positioning) of each element are consistent with the target cloned site

✅ The box-shadows of each element are consistent with the target cloned site

✅ The buttons are consistent with the target cloned site

✅ The menus are consistent with the target cloned site

✅ The mouse-pointers are consistent with industry standards

✅ The hover effects on each element are consistent with the target cloned site

✅ The icons used are comparable with the target cloned site

✅ FontAwesomeLinks to an external site. must be used for icons

You can use FlexBox

You can use Grid.css

MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT DO THE FOLLOWING
❌ Don't copy/paste the HTML element structure directly from the application that you are cloning
❌ Don't copy the CSS styling directly from the application that you are cloning
❌ Don't look at or copy the HTML element structure from another student's application
❌ Don't look at or copy the CSS styling from another student's application
❌ Don't work on CSS animations or transitions
❌ Don't use any React component library (MaterialUI, Ant Design, etc)
❌ Don't use any UI/CSS frameworks (Tailwind, Bootstrap, etc.)
Important Note: If you wish to use a CSS/JavaScript library or NPM package, you must consult and get approval from your Project Advisor.

If you have any questions, or if you are not sure if your feature meets these minimum CSS requirements, please consult your Project Advisor.

## Github Readme Notes

GitHub Projet README
Writing a README
Every project on your resume needs a great README.

Review Github's markdown guideLinks to an external site. before you begin. You can also use StackEditLinks to an external site., a browser editor that renders your markdown side-by-side as you write. It's incredibly important to format your README professionally. Don't cut corners here or you will look inexperienced. When it is time to create your README, you should allocate about three hours to guarantee you have enough time to make your project shine.

Generally, you will put your README on your frontend repo if you have separate backend and frontend. To organize your README, you can link to a documentation page that contains all the individual links, or link sections from the README. You can also use GitHub's Wiki feature if you would like. Your README should have an index with the following links:

Feature list document
React Components list (if you used React)
Database Schema (if you used a database)
frontend routes document
API routes document (if you have a backend API)
Redux store tree document (if you used Redux)
Your project README also needs to include all the following pieces of information:

Name of the project
Link to live site
Link to your backend repo if you have a separate one
Summary of what the project is and what it does
Screenshots of your app in action (once completed)
Instructions on how to build/run the project (installation instructions)
List of techs/languages/plugins/APIs used
To-dos/future features
Technical implementation details
Anything you had to stop and think about before building
Descriptions of particular challenges
Snippets or links to see code for these
Best Practices
Divide your README into distinct sections
List the technologies used at the top of your README for increased visibility
Include nice screenshots or GIFs to show and demonstrate features of your application
Include code snippets
Include link to the live site
Provide instructions for how to install project (if applicable)
Include list of technologies used in the project
Include list of any third party APIs you used in the project

## Git and Deployment Best Practices

In this article, you will review best practices related to Git workflow and deployment of your projects.

You are expected to follow these best practices on all App Academy projects.

Git Workflow: Feature -> Dev -> Main
You have already been introduced to the feature branch -> dev branch -> main branch pattern of development.

In short, every time you start working on a new feature, you should create a new feature branch that ONLY includes work on that specific feature. You should test your code changes to that branch locally, and when you are satisfied with the feature's behavior and styling, you can merge it to the dev branch.

The dev branch should only include code for completed features. You can check how all of your current features work together by testing the dev branch locally.

The main branch should only include production-ready code. This means that the code has been thoroughly tested locally and is ready for deployment.

Only merge your dev branch into your main branch when you are ready to deploy the updated code.

Protecting Branches
One way to ensure that you are following this Git workflow is to set branch protection rules on your project repository. For example, you can set a protection rule that a pull request is required, or that a certain number of approvals are required, before merging to the main branch. This can help prevent accidental pushes to main.

To set a branch protection rule, click on the "Settings" tab of your repository in GitHub. Click on "Branches" in the left sidebar. Next, fill out the form to set your branch name and the protection criteria. When you are finished, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the "Create" button.

For example, the image below sets a protection on the main branch, requiring a pull request before a merge to main can be completed.

<img src='/home/mikaelajadetaylor/aa-projects/unicorn-landing/frontend/znotes/branch-protection-rule.png'>


Auto-deployment is a best practice because it allows your users (as well as your instructors and/or collaborators) to always access your most up-to-date production-ready code.

WARNING: Ignoring Best Practices
This article lays out best practices for your Git workflow, which allows you to use auto-deployment for your site. These are basic expectations for all App Academy projects.

Be aware that there are consequences of not following these best practices. If you do not follow the feature -> dev -> main pattern as you work on your project, you will risk running out of build minutes on your Render account.

Running out of build minutes will impact ALL of your projects that are hosted on Render. See this article on Build LimitsLinks to an external site. for more details on how build minutes are calculated, and what to do if you run out of build minutes for your projects.
